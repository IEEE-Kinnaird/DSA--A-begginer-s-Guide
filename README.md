# Competitive Coding Practice Rounds

## Introduction
Welcome to the **Competitive Coding Practice Rounds**.
This initiative aims to strengthen students' problem-solving abilities and proficiency in data structures and algorithms. It is designed to help students excel in technical interviews and competitive coding rounds, enhancing their career prospects.

## Objectives
### Primary Objective:
- Develop and enhance students' problem-solving skills and knowledge of data structures and algorithms.

### Secondary Objectives:
- Assist students in building strong profiles on LeetCode.
- Create a consistent and supportive learning environment through regular practice and collaboration.
- Prepare students for the technical challenges they will face in interviews and competitive coding events.

## Session Structure
- **Frequency**: Weekly online sessions (1.5 hours) on weekends.
- **Tentative Time Slot**: Tuesdays, 1:00 PM - 2:30 PM.
- **Format**: Combination of online and monthly in-person sessions.

### Categories:
- **Data Structures and Algorithms**: Covering a broad range of topics from basic data structures to complex algorithms.

### Agenda:
- Each session will discuss at least one problem class (e.g., Binary Search, Sliding Window).
- Multiple related questions will be solved during the session.

## Incentives and Rewards
- All participants will receive e-certificates.
- Top five performers will win:
  - Free registration pass for TECHFUSION 2.0's Flash Coding Competition.
  - Exclusive WIE and CS Club swag kits.

### Closing Ceremony:
- A small ceremony to recognize top performers and celebrate all participants' efforts.

## Implementation Plan
### Resources Required:
- Access to the LeetCode platform.
- A communication platform (WhatsApp/Slack) for updates and ongoing guidance.
- On-campus venue for monthly sessions (e.g., NB-7 or Amaltas Lab).

### Tracking Progress:
- Regular updates and weekly tasks shared in the communication platform.
- Encouragement for active participation and sharing of progress.

## Expected Outcomes
- **Short-term**: Enhanced problem-solving skills and understanding of data structures and algorithms.
- **Long-term**: Improved profiles on LeetCode and better preparation for technical interviews and coding competitions.

## Evaluation and Feedback
- Participant feedback collected through surveys after each session.
- Periodic reviews to ensure content relevance and effectiveness.
